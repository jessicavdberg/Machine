South Africa has extremely high levels of poverty for an upper middle-class country. To help reduce the poverty levels, the government has many grants that are available to households that intend to improve the quality of life of poor South Africanâ€™s. However, accurate targeting is challenging due to the lack of income data. Machine learning techniques can improve the distribution of grants by predicting poverty levels. This paper will show that decision trees and random forest models predict poverty levels with a high degree of accuracy in South Africa.
